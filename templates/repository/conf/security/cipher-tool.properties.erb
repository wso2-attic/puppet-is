# Important: This properties file contains all the aliases to be used in carbon components. If any property need to
#be secured, you need to add alias name, file name and the xpath as follows:.
# The value goes as, the <file_name>//<xpath>,<true/false>
# where <file_name> - is the file (along with the file path) to be secured,
#       <xpath> - is the xpath to the property value to be secured
#       <true / false> - This is true if the last parameter in the xpath is parameter (starts with [ and ends with ])
# and you want its value to be replaced with "password"
